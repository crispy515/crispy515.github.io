## This is my first blog post.

Hi there, somehow you made your way to my blog.

Sydney has finally cooled down but the streets have been heating up with Vivid, I happened to go a few times, yet only once for the actual light installations. 

Honestly, I wasn't very invested in the giant walk, but I do like this photo I took, take a look!
